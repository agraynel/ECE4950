I did not use pandas this time.
Instead, I just import *.csv and parse it.

In this sentence,
os.chdir('/Users/Agraynel/Desktop/ECE4950/hw0’),
set the work directory, where I put hw0.py and heightsagetest.csv in it.

The test csv must be named as ‘heightsagetest.csv’.

I met some problems which related to the element in the rows are string instead of int, so I need to cast the string into int before compare them.
